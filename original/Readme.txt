A little word-game to test your typing speed! :)

The original idea for this game came from a computer game
called "Typing of the Dead" which is based on the "House of
the Dead"-series.

Please don't cry if the hardest difficulty level seems too hard,
that's meant for really fast people only! :)

The #1 question on your mind must be: What cool mp3s did I listen
while writing a kick-ass game like this?? I was listening to
LightForce.

Note: if you feel that some words/sentences feel dumb/lame,
you can edit them yourself in the text files.
